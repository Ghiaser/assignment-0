Part 1 – Crash Analysis
On April 11th, 2019, the Israeli Beresheet lunar lander crashed during its final descent to the Moon’s surface. According to official reports, the crash was caused by a malfunction in the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which triggered a series of system faults. A reset command was issued to the IMU, but this unintentionally shut down the main engine. The system failed to recover in time, and the lander impacted the Moon at high speed.
Following the IMU fault, ground control attempted to restore the engine, but by the time thrust was re-engaged, the lander had already lost too much altitude. The mission highlights the importance of fault tolerance, redundancy, and real-time monitoring in autonomous systems.
Part 2 – 2D Simulation Setup and PID Control
The simulation models Beresheet's descent from an altitude of 30,000 meters and an initial horizontal velocity of 1700 m/s. The simulation includes:
- Vertical and horizontal motion using PID control
- Moon gravity: 1.62 m/s²
- Main engine thrust: 430 N (vertical)
- Side engine thrust: 200 N (horizontal total)
- Mass variation due to fuel burn
- PID controllers with basic tuning
- Target landing speeds: < 2.5 m/s (both vertical and horizontal)
The simulation assumes known orientation and focuses on reducing speed while conserving fuel.
Part 3 – Results
Final values at landing:
- Altitude: 0.0 m
- Vertical Velocity: -2.3 m/s
- Horizontal Velocity: 1.6 m/s
- Mass: 158.2 kg
Observation:
The simulation achieves a successful soft landing under the required velocity constraints. The PID controller tuning is basic but effective, with some oscillation in speed. The fuel usage is acceptable, and some fuel remains at landing.
Appendix – Graphs
The following plots were generated by the simulation:
- Altitude over time
- Vertical and horizontal velocities over time
- Mass over time
- Vertical thrust acceleration over time
These graphs help visualize the descent profile and verify the safety and fuel efficiency of the landing.

Conclusion
This assignment demonstrated the application of physical modeling, control systems, and simulation techniques in the context of an autonomous lunar landing. The simulation successfully modeled the key aspects of the descent and provided insights into system behavior under PID control.
